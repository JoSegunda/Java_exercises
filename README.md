Welcome to the Java Exercises repository!
This project contains a series of beginner-to-intermediate Java programming challenges designed to help
practice fundamental concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, methods, and basic OOP.

Each exercise focuses on a specific programming skill or problem type.
The goal is to write small, self-contained programs that reinforce understanding of core Java syntax and logic.
All exercises are organized and numbered for easy navigation.

You can see them in the project WIKI.
